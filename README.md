# T4_PPS_PIN8
A hyper-minimal Arduino library for turning Pin 8 on a Teensy 4.0 into a 1 pulse-per-second output
Standard TeensyDuino timer/PWM features for slow timing are not yet availble for the Teensy 4.x series. Look to
using the Teensy 3.2 for a far-more flexible slow PPS-like timing output.

This is primarily from here: https://github.com/manitou48/teensy4/blob/master/qtmrxpwm.ino
